                <h2>Fortnite: Accident Zero</h2>
                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>A mysterious girl named Laura gets transported to a new reality called “Reality Zero”, the home of
                    The
                    Zero Point. It has seeked her out specifically as she has been selected as the chosen one. The one
                    who
                    would control all aspects of reality and protect the Zero Point from any wrong doings. Unfortunately
                    for
                    her, she ended up in a highly secure bunker owned by a secret organization. This organization was
                    quick
                    to figure out what kind of girl Laura was and they did all kinds of messed up things with her to see
                    what they could do with her. One day, she gets thrown into the Zero Point itself and this is where
                    the
                    Zero Point was able to grant Laura the power of the chosen one, allowing her to free herself when
                    the
                    opportunity presented itself. Luckily, Laura did not need to wait too long for that to happen as
                    later
                    that night a mysterious woman opened her prison door, setting her free. From there, she destroyed
                    the
                    secret bunker. This incident became known as “Accident Zero”.</p>
                <p>From there, Laura was left alone able to explore a whole new world by herself. This is where she
                    noticed
                    that she was stuck in a loop and despite many losing their memories after 22 minutes, she kept hers.
                    And
                    she took advantage of that. Laura was able to free herself from the loop pretty quickly thanks to
                    her
                    new found zero point powers but despite her freedom, she came back simply because she started to
                    enjoy
                    the experience the loop gave her.</p>
                <p>One day, a strange purple cube appeared, slowly making its way to a location called Loot Lake. While
                    this
                    happened, Laura grew close to the cube due to her loneliness at the time. She even gave it the
                    nickname,
                    “Kevin”. Originally, this cube was meant to destroy the island itself but it also served a second
                    purpose, finding a specific person to exploit for a faction called The Last Reality. Kevin the Cube
                    dissolved into the waters of loot lake and came back a few days later. Weeks later, it exploded,
                    leaving
                    many fragments of itself behind. Laura witnessed all of this and decided to retrieve a piece of the
                    Cube
                    to keep a memory of a lost friend. She used it as a part of her first self made weapon, a scythe
                    called
                    “The Darkstrike Scythe”. Little does Laura know that this was all planned out by The Last Reality in
                    an
                    attempt to corrupt her and add her to their rankings. The progress was slow, but it worked.</p>
                <p>Later on, Laura encounters the mysterious woman again. This woman turns out to be someone called Demi
                    Kaneko, an ex-member of the mysterious organization. At first, Laura does not remember who Demi is.
                    Because of that, they started fighting as this has become a habit for Laura whenever she encounters
                    someone. Demi did not want to hurt Laura so she stayed as passive as possible, dodging many attacks.
                    Unfortunately for Demi, she made one misstep, allowing Laura to cut her right arm off with her
                    scythe.
                    Falling to her knees, Demi said something which made Laura burst out of tears, finally realizing who
                    Demi is. She felt an enormous amount of guilt which gave Demi the upperhand to end the fight
                    peacefully.
                    Back in the day Demi used to take care of Laura. And so, Laura finally accepted Demi and started
                    viewing
                    her as her mother figure from now on.</p>
                <p>Some time passed and Demi was safely able to conclude that something was off with Laura. Her behavior
                    did
                    not match up with what it was some time ago and her health has heavily declined ever since The Final
                    Showdown happened between a big mech and a monster from the Ocean, which resulted in the Zero Point
                    being left in a bad state. Demi went to a new ally/old foe called The Scientist to ask for further
                    assistants and together they were able to conclude that Laura’s health was connected to the Zero
                    Point
                    directly and only worsened by some sort of corruption. Luckily for them, The Scientist had a perfect
                    solution to solve the issue! A special purifier bracelet designed to purify anyone who wears it but
                    also
                    enhancing their abilities. With this bracelet, Laura would not only be cured from her corruption but
                    also be turned into the best version of herself as The Chosen One. Only issue is, they do not have
                    the
                    parts required to make this bracelet. This is where their quest to find all the parts necessary
                    started.
                    However, The Scientist had some bad news and told Demi about their plans to reset the Zero Point.
                    They
                    plan on destroying the Zero Point by launching a big meteor into it, which would cause a chain
                    reaction,
                    resulting in a new big bang of some sort. Laura tried fighting back as she felt like it was her
                    duty,
                    but she was enable to do so as she was powerless. In the end,The Scientist, together with the other
                    members of The Seven, was able to successfully reset the Zero Point back to a stable state. This
                    however
                    resulted in Laura entering a long coma, as she was not able to properly resist the initial shock the
                    destruction of the Zero Point gave her.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <p>Months to a year have passed and Laura finally woke up again, only to be right back into bad shape
                    because of her corruption getting stronger and stronger as time passed by and the current state of
                    the Zero Point, as it was back into bad shape again. While Laura was knocked out, Demi worked as a
                    special agent for a man called Midas. She took care of special missions for Midas in exchange for
                    resources to hunt down the parts needed for the purifier bracelet. Demi was overjoyed about Laura’s
                    awakening. The timing was perfect, now Laura and Demi could hunt for the parts needed together.
                    Unfortunately for them, because of the current state of the Zero Point, the mysterious organization,
                    also known as The Imagined Order decided it was finally time to intervene and they instructed their
                    Elite Guard to hunt down anyone trying to mess with The Zero Point. The team consists of Sakuya the
                    combat expert, Jade the Scientist, and their leader Orion the Hunter. They are a force to be
                    reckoned with. On a usual patrol, Sakuya was able to spot Laura and Demi. And so, the hunter has
                    found its new prey. From that day forward, Laura and Demi were hunted by Orion and Sakuya, while
                    Jade was working on different projects in the background. </p>
                <p>In the short span of time where the Elite Guard hunted down the duo, Demi and Sakuya started some
                    kind of rivalry between each other. This rivalry has always been present as Demi and Sakuya were
                    sisters, always trying to one up each other. Orion however was more focused on something else, or
                    rather, SOMEONE else. His focus was mainly on defeating Demi, capturing Laura and getting her back
                    to their base so they can continue with their plans. Orion wanted to take control of Laura so he
                    could take over The Imagined Order, as he deemed Geno unfit as its leader. Luckily enough, with the
                    help of Demi, Laura was able to remain free from Orion’s grasp. And together they were able to
                    complete one out of the two parts necessary for the purifier bracelet, that being the metal for the
                    frame.</p>
                <p>A few months later the island gets invaded by Aliens. These aliens are here with 1 goal in mind,
                    taking the Zero Point for themselves. This meant that the Imagined Order, including the Elite Guard,
                    was rather busy protecting the Zero Point instead of hunting down Laura and Demi. This meant that
                    they were finally able to freely move again without needing to worry about getting into a fight.
                    These aliens were rather hostile against anyone they encountered. But oddly enough, they seem to
                    never be aggressive towards Laura specifically.
                    Demi remembered the last part needed for the purifier bracelet, that being an energy containment
                    unit. And with a mothership above the island itself, Demi thinks they could find the part inside it.
                    So they made a plan to get the final part and finally free Laura from her corruption. Unknown to
                    them though, the duo walked right into the Last Reality’s trap. Once Laura entered the mothership
                    she got captured while Demi got thrown out, witnessing it explode. While falling, she saw a lot of
                    new purple cubes falling down onto the island.
                </p>
                <p>A week has passed and the Last Reality has invaded the island with a new weapon on their side, a dark
                    version of Laura. Demi knows she has to put a stop to this, or at least get Laura back to safety, so
                    she kept searching for the final part needed for the purifier bracelet until she found it. When Demi
                    found the energy containment unit in some rubble from the mothership, she assembled the purifier
                    bracelet and prepared to confront Laura. Once Demi and Laura got face to face they started fighting,
                    just like they did two years ago. The fight at first seemed pretty one sided but Demi noticed one
                    big flaw, Laura’s lack of emotion, it was a weakness ready to be exploited. In the end, the purifier
                    bracelet was not needed as Demi was able to free Laura from her corruption by simply showing the one
                    thing she truly desired.</p>
                <p>Love.</p>
                <p>This, however, was not the end of their fight as The Cube Queen herself came to deal with her
                    failure. In the end, Laura and Demi were not able to defeat the Cube Queen but luckily for them The
                    Seven came to their rescue and helped them escape the corrupted island and defeat The Cube Queen.
                    For now at least. Demi and Laura were sadly not able to defeat their enemies this time around. But
                    now, on a new island, they were finally able to live life as mother and daughter for a short while.
