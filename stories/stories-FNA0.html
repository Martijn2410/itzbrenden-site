                <h2>Fortnite: Accident Zero</h2>
                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>A mysterious girl named Laura is transported to a new reality called "Reality Zero," home to the powerful Zero Point. It has specifically chosen her as its protector, the one who would control all aspects of reality, time and space, and keep the Zero Point safe from harm. Unfortunately for Laura, she materializes inside a highly secure bunker owned by a secret organization. Quickly realizing her unique nature, the organization subjects her to a series of cruel experiments, testing the limits of her abilities.</p>
                <p>One day, she is thrown into the Zero Point itself, where its power awakens her full potential, granting her the abilities of the Chosen One. Soon after, a mysterious woman frees her from her cell, giving Laura the chance to escape. Wasting no time, she unleashes her newfound powers and destroys the bunker, an event that becomes known as "Accident Zero."</p>
                <p>Finally free, Laura explores her new world and soon discovers that she is trapped in a mysterious loop. While most lose their memories after 22 minutes, she retains hers and takes full advantage of this anomaly. With her abilities, she breaks free from the loop but, surprisingly, chooses to return, drawn to the thrill of the experience.</p>
                <p>One day, a massive purple cube appears, making its way toward a location called Loot Lake. Lonely and seeking companionship, Laura develops an attachment to the cube, affectionately naming it "Kevin." Though its true purpose is to destroy the island and serve the faction known as The Last Reality, it also seeks out a specific individual to exploit. After dissolving into Loot Lake’s waters, Kevin resurfaces and eventually explodes, leaving behind fragments of itself. Laura, deeply affected by its destruction, retrieves a shard as a keepsake. She forges it into her first self-made weapon, a scythe, called "The Darkstrike Scythe." Unbeknownst to her, this is all part of The Last Reality's plan to corrupt and recruit her into their ranks. Slowly, their influence begins to take hold.</p>
                <p>Later, Laura encounters the mysterious woman who freed her. She reveals herself as Demi Kaneko, a former member of the secret organization that imprisoned Laura. At first, Laura does not recognize Demi, and a fight ensues, a habit Laura has developed when meeting new opponents. Demi, unwilling to hurt her, stays on the defensive, dodging attacks. However, when she makes one misstep, Laura severs her right arm with the scythe. As Demi collapses, she utters something that triggers a flood of memories in Laura. Overcome with emotion, Laura breaks down in tears, finally realizing who Demi is. Filled with guilt, she ceases fighting, allowing Demi to bring her temporarily back from the darkness that took over. Demi, once her caretaker, now becomes the mother figure she never had.</p>
                <p>Time passes, and Demi notices something is wrong with Laura. Her behavior is off, and her health has declined ever since the battle known as "The Final Showdown," where a colossal mech fought a sea monster, leaving the Zero Point destabilized. Seeking answers, Demi contacts an old enemy now an ally, The Scientist. Together, they discover that Laura’s health is directly linked to the Zero Point and worsened by the corruption seeping into her. Fortunately, The Scientist has a solution. A special purifier bracelet designed to cleanse corruption and enhance abilities. However, the materials needed to construct it are scarce. As Demi and Laura embark on their quest to gather the necessary components, The Scientist warns Demi of a plan to reset the Zero Point by crashing a meteor into it, triggering a cosmic reset. Laura, feeling an obligation to stop them, attempts to intervene but is powerless. The reset is carried out successfully, restoring balance but at a cost. Laura falls into a deep coma, unable to withstand the shock of the Zero Point’s destruction.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <p>Months pass, possibly even a year, before Laura finally awakens. However, her corruption has worsened, and the Zero Point is once again unstable because of some big cosmic event involving a bunch of heroes fighting off a very big entity that tried to consume the Zero Point. While she was unconscious, Demi worked as a special agent for Midas, exchanging her services for resources to help complete the purifier bracelet. Overjoyed at Laura's return, Demi believes they can now finish their mission together.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, The Imagined Order, the secret organization behind Laura’s original captivity, sees the Zero Point’s unstable state as a reason to intervene. They deploy their Elite Guard, consisting of Sakuya, the combat expert; Jade, the scientist; and their leader, Orion, the pro-hunter. These formidable Elite Agents are tasked with eliminating anyone meddling with the Zero Point. On a secret patrol, Sakuya was able to spot Laura and Demi. From that day forward, Laura and Demi were hunted by Orion and Sakuya, while Jade was working on different projects in the background in an attempt to finally take down their targets.</p>
                <p>As Demi and Laura evade their relentless pursuers, Demi and Sakuya's sibling rivalry reignites. Meanwhile, Orion focuses on capturing Laura, intending to harness her power to overthrow his own leader, Geno. Despite the relentless attacks, Demi and Laura successfully retrieve a very important material needed for the purifier bracelet, the metal for its frame.</p>
                <p>All was going well for the Elite Guard, but their mission got interrupted by a sudden alien invasion. The extraterrestrial force, led by The Last Reality, seeks the Zero Point for themselves. The Imagined Order, now preoccupied with defending the island, temporarily abandons their pursuit of Laura and Demi. The aliens are hostile to all, except for Laura for some strange reason. Their lack of aggression toward her is unsettling and was a sign of something being off.</p>
                <p>After finding out that the final component needed for the bracelet is an energy containment unit, Demi makes up a plan to retrieve it from the only place that could have one, the alien mothership. However, what Demi did not expect was that their mission was all predicted and went according to the Last Realities carefully crafted plan. It was all a trap. As soon as Laura steps inside the mothership, she is captured, and Demi is thrown out, left to watch in horror as the mothership explodes, releasing countless purple cubes onto the island.</p>
                <p>A week later, The Last Reality launches a full-scale invasion, revealing their trump card, a dark, corrupted version of Laura. With the full power of the Guardian of time and Space at their side, they were basically unstoppable. Determined to save Laura, Demi locates the last missing piece of the bracelet and confronts the corrupted Laura. Their battle is intense, but Demi soon notices Laura’s had a big weakness. All but two emotions remained. Anger and fear. Demi is able to exploit this void of emotions by appealing to what Laura wanted most, feeling beloved and cared for. In the end Demi did not need a special device to solve Laura’s problems. All she needed was some love from a carrying parent. Something Demi would happily provide.</p>
                <p>Even though the corruption is gone, their struggle is far from over. The Cube Queen herself arrives, determined to finish what she started.Laura and Demi, now together on the same side again, are able to put up a good fight. But in the end this was not enough. With one powerful attack they are shot far away from the island, surviving by landing into the deep oceans surrounding the island. Demi and Laura are eventually rescued by The Seven, who help them escape to a new island. Though they have not won the war against the IO just yet, for now, they are free. At last, Laura and Demi can live in peace as mother and daughter, if only for a short while.</p>
