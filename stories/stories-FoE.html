                <h2>Fate of Existence</h2>
                <h3>Written by: Chillin'Cheeto14</h3>
                <p>As the sky fades from a reddish color to dark grey, this signifies that the end is near. All of humanity has been wiped out, and the last remaining heroes who were seen as the last hope, are gone. The cubes of existence have successfully synchronized, killing everyone in the process. Demise thought she had success, but somehow, only one remains in the entire world. Her name is Laura, and she is the only survivor to survive this ongoing calamity. She stands at the center of various destroyed roads, between collapsed buildings, in the middle of a soon-to-be-destroyed planet.</p>
                <p>Massive amounts of blood flood the streets, gradually evaporating away. The 4L Spyder Units continue roaming across Earth, crushing everything everywhere until all remains flattened to nothingness. Seeing everything filled with pure chaos and destruction, Laura can't handle it anymore. Seeing her friends gradually vanish and die in front of her eyes helplessly is the last thing she wants to experience in this war. She has lost so many loved ones in the past already. Tears begin sliding down her face.</p>
                <p>She fails to contain her anger and dashes towards Demise. Her anger reawakens her Zero Point abilities once more. As she runs, Laura transforms into her Breaking Point form. Her wings open wide, as she jumps and soars high, diving back down at a high speed, aiming at Demise. But Demise already sees this attack incoming, and unleashes her blades once again. She swings her blades at a very high speed. Both Laura and Demise miss their attacks. After Laura lands, she swiftly turns around and sees Demise gone. 0.1 seconds later, Demise charges at very high speeds behind Laura and aims for a full slice across her torso. Laura dodges in time and counterattacks with a strong kick. Demise blocks the kick with her left blade, and tries to counterattack by utilizing her right blade to slice Laura’s face. Laura falls back and succeeds landing various impactful punches, damaging Demise's face instead.</p>
                <p>The punching, slashing, and clashing continue at an unfathomable speed. Laura then utilizes her Cosmic Space ability, increasing her speed as an advantage. She generates rifts, using them to teleport around Demise, and continuously land attacks. Demise, on the other hand, reads every attack and blocks/dodges every single one. Demise rapidly learns that Laura cannot be hit, as her infinite space makes her immune to any attack. Demise then swiftly jumps in one of those rifts, takes her blades out again, and blocks Laura with them, causing an explosive impact causing them both to crash back onto the ground a couple of feet away. Feeling concerned, Laura gets up and utilizes her time-out ability, stopping time completely. As Demise and everything else freezes, Laura takes less than a second to look around and analyze her surroundings. She sees various cars destroyed at the side of what was once used to be a road. Less than a second later, they were suddenly closer to her, but they all weren't moving. Laura then feels an intense pain in her back and her face. It turns out Demise kicked Laura so hard while she looked away for that fraction of a second, that she crashed into those cars without any proper reaction time.</p>

                <p>Demise utilized her beyond-time ability, which allows her to sense and reject time-stopping abilities, and faked being affected by the time-out ability. Laura then begins to question who Demise is, how Demise successfully synchronized both abilities and how they were negated. Before she could even think about that, she gets ambushed and begins to trade off attacks at even faster, unfathomable speeds. This seems to never end. Demise somehow manages to grab onto Laura, and lands a very powerful punch against her as she goes straight into the ground, shaking everything nearby and creating a massive divot. Laura stands back up and blocks a second impact. Laura quickly flees and flies around and around at very high speeds, surrounding Demise inside a smoke vortex above the crater. Blinding the surrounding area, Laura finds the perfect chance and flies in, stabbing Demise's left blade, and leaving behind some Zero Point energy, corrupting the blade bit by bit. Demise acts very quickly, and does the unthinkable. Demise quickly absorbs the Zero Point energy left on her wounded blade, and regenerates it as if nothing ever happened.</p>
                <p>Demise orders one of the colossal 4L Spyder Units miles away to aim at Laura. The unit quickly turns its head, aims at Laura, and quickly charges its chaos beam, now able to detect and track Zero Point energy due to a mysterious weaponry data transfer. Laura was left stunned, as the colossal being was able to move quickly despite being massive in size. Right before it fires, the unit explodes and begins to collapse. The explosion was so big, that Laura and Demise got launched backward at very high speeds, making them both unable to move for a few seconds. After the massive explosion, Demise was unable to connect or command any 4L Spyder Units across the globe. Distraught, Demise ponders how this could've happened. Those machines were unkillable. Unless something or someone could've known how to defeat them...</p>
                <p>Laura takes this critical opportunity and snaps and crumbles Demise's left blade which angers her even more. She has gotten a bit weaker, however, Demise swiftly swings at Laura using her other blade, refocusing most of her focus and strength into that remaining blade, landing a 100% guaranteed direct hit. Laura got extremely lucky and caught her attack with her legs. Unfortunately, Laura gets stuck with the blade, which begins to carve through her armor. Demise spins at ultra-high speeds, and launches Laura with immense force, sending her flying far away at very high speeds. Laura collides and goes through countless buildings, injuring her severely. A mass amount of rocks and debris fell on top of her, completely covering her. The amount of pain she's bearing from the countless impacts is immense, but she must keep up with this fight.</p>
                <p>If Laura fails to fight on, all of existence will be jeopardized. She must defend the whole omniverse. Demise is a grave danger to the omniverse, to everything... This situation is more important than ever before. The Guardian of Reality must find a way to defeat The Hatred of all Existence. Laura then lifts the heavy debris out of her way and sees the dark grey sky again. Determined, she soars very high into the sky, trying to locate where Demise is.</p>
                <p>After locating Demise, Laura recovers quickly and begins to overcharge Zero Point energy, more than she has ever before in her lifetime. Due to absolutely zero limitations, Laura continuously collects even more ZP energy and begins to align her position high up in the sky. Whenever she's ready, she'll be able to land one of the biggest impacts against Demise, hoping for the best outcome in the end. Right before she charges at full speed, Laura suddenly sees something big fly past her left at an extremely rapid speed. She uses her time-out ability again to go back in time to see what it was. This time, Laura can see Hush, looking WAY more powerful than ever, with an unusual bracelet on her right arm. As Hush dives towards Demise’s location, Laura gets pushed far away from the unrecognizable, divine power. Two seconds later, a huge impact can be seen and heard, as everything lights up VERY brightly, making it almost impossible to see. An explosion can be seen a few seconds later, and it is marvelous. Laura was in awe seeing the explosion from afar... she had never seen something like this before. The impact was so immense, that Laura and other debris were sent flying with a powerful force MILES away. The explosion continued to expand, which ended up surrounding the whole planet. Laura couldn't see anything, as everything began to emit white. She had to close her eyes. Her body was floating high in the white sky, feeling at peace, peace she had never felt before…</p>

                <p>After walking up a hill, Laura finds Hush sitting on the ground, pondering while looking at the decapitated head of Demise. Laura looks closer and begins questioning how and why Hush and Demise look extremely similar. Was Demise a failed experiment, did Hush become Demise... how and why was Demise created?? Laura decides to hold those thoughts for later and walks toward Hush. Hush then notices Laura walking up to her, and they both run towards each other and hug. Tears ran down both their faces…</p>
                <p>Suddenly, the bracelet on Hush's right arm begins acting up, causing some weird energy to burst out and escape. Hush and Laura get pushed back by a great distance, as the unknown energy begins to swing around. Hush tries to control it with her arm, but the energy is far too powerful to control at this point. What is happening? Is this power controlling itself, or by whom? However, Hush couldn’t believe her eyes as she began to see everyone who had fallen during battle come back to life. She breathes in relief, can’t hold her tears anymore, and rushes to hug everyone who has returned. Laura ran back and couldn’t believe her eyes either. Hush talks to everyone and after a few minutes, she decides to walk away to see how the world has succumbed and survived the calamity. Everyone else follows Hush as they too wish to join her.</p>
                <p>Laura walks beside Hush and notices something over the distance. She can see an unknown girl standing and looking at something. Laura rushes towards her but then she suddenly disappears. Right before she disappeared, Laura managed to get a small glance at the bracelet in her arm, and how it looked very similar to the one Hush was wearing minutes before, before it disappeared too. Who is this mysterious girl, and why was she here? What are the power’s limitations? Was she the one who lent Hush that immense divine power, and why?</p>
                <p>Laura decides to hold these questions for now as well, since she knows she’ll expect to get the answers at some point in the future, in some way or another.</p>

                <p>Several months later, Laura arrives in a helicopter at the top of a building where Hush is standing. Hush turns back and is happy to see Laura once again. As Laura steps out of the helicopter, Hush invites Laura to cherish a magnificent view of the new city being built over the distance. They begin talking and laughing, reminiscing old memories and how Laura played an important role during recent crucial times. After a while, Laura stares at the new future city one more time and invites Hush to go along with her in the helicopter. As they lift off, Laura tells Hush that she was able to set up a small dinner hangout with Mackenzie, to talk things over and enjoy some nice food. This news excites Hush, knowing things will get better in the long run. Laura also tells Hush that she is a brave, young individual and that everyone will forever cherish and appreciate her bravery. Those words made Hush let some tears out.</p>
                <p>They both understand that even though the future can change based on even the smallest and most complex events, everything has an answer, as nothing is ever meant to be perfect.</p>
                <p>THE END, for now.</p>
